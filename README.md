## Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery

### Overview

A simple Make Change application.  The program will initially greet the user, then ask for an input of the price of an item they are buying in dollars.  Following the accepted input, it will then ask for the amount tendered to the cashier from the user to pay for this item. If the user enters the exact amount the item costs as the tender, the program will tell them that is the exact amount.  If they do not input enough to cover the cost of the item, the program will give an error message while allowing the user to enter a larger tender if they wish.  If they say yes, it will ask for a new tender input.  If they say no, the program will quit.

Change will be produced after the expected inputs (when tender is greater than the price) by using larger denominations first, with $20 bills as the largest, all the way to pennies as the smallest. The program will give back the change with the number of bills and coins in order, highest to lowest.  Also, if multiple bills/coins were used, they will be given back in the plural form.  If a single denomination is used, it will be shown singular (i.e, 1 penny instead of 1 pennies).  The program will work for large numbers, but still only break down the change with no bill higher than a $20.
